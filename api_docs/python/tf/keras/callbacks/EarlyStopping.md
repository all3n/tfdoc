## Class `EarlyStopping`

Stop training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping"><code>tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping</code></a>
* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping"><code>tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping</code></a>


<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Arguments:


* <b>`monitor`</b>: Quantity to be monitored.
* <b>`min_delta`</b>: Minimum change in the monitored quantity
    to qualify as an improvement, i.e. an absolute
    change of less than min_delta, will count as no
    improvement.
* <b>`patience`</b>: Number of epochs with no improvement
    after which training will be stopped.
* <b>`verbose`</b>: verbosity mode.
* <b>`mode`</b>: One of `{"auto", "min", "max"}`. In `min` mode,
    training will stop when the quantity
    monitored has stopped decreasing; in `max`
    mode it will stop when the quantity
    monitored has stopped increasing; in `auto`
    mode, the direction is automatically inferred
    from the name of the monitored quantity.
* <b>`baseline`</b>: Baseline value for the monitored quantity.
    Training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement over the
    baseline.
* <b>`restore_best_weights`</b>: Whether to restore model weights from
    the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity.
    If False, the model weights obtained at the last step of
    training are used.


#### Example:



```python
callback = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
# This callback will stop the training when there is no improvement in
# the validation loss for three consecutive epochs.
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=100, callbacks=[callback],
    validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
```
