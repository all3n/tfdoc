## Class `History`

Callback that records events into a `History` object.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/History"><code>tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.History</code></a>
* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/History"><code>tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.History</code></a>


<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This callback is automatically applied to
every Keras model. The `History` object
gets returned by the `fit` method of models.
