## Class `Callback`

Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.



### Aliases:

* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback"><code>tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.Callback</code></a>
* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback"><code>tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.Callback</code></a>


<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Attributes:


* <b>`params`</b>: dict. Training parameters
    (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
* <b>`model`</b>: instance of <a href="../../../tf/keras/Model"><code>keras.models.Model</code></a>.
    Reference of the model being trained.
* <b>`validation_data`</b>: Deprecated. Do not use.

The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
the current batch or epoch.

Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Model` class
will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
it passes to its callbacks:

    on_epoch_end: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
        optionally include `val_loss`
        (if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
        (if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
    on_batch_begin: logs include `size`,
        the number of samples in the current batch.
    on_batch_end: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
        (if accuracy monitoring is enabled).
