## Class `ReduceLROnPlateau`

Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.

Inherits From: [`Callback`](../../../tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

### Aliases:

* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau"><code>tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau</code></a>
* Class <a href="/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau"><code>tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau</code></a>


<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Models often benefit from reducing the learning rate by a factor
of 2-10 once learning stagnates. This callback monitors a
quantity and if no improvement is seen for a 'patience' number
of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.

#### Example:



```python
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2,
                              patience=5, min_lr=0.001)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[reduce_lr])
```

#### Arguments:


* <b>`monitor`</b>: quantity to be monitored.
* <b>`factor`</b>: factor by which the learning rate will be reduced. new_lr = lr *
  factor
* <b>`patience`</b>: number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate
  will be reduced.
* <b>`verbose`</b>: int. 0: quiet, 1: update messages.
* <b>`mode`</b>: one of {auto, min, max}. In `min` mode, lr will be reduced when the
  quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `max` mode it will be
  reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in `auto`
  mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the
  monitored quantity.
* <b>`min_delta`</b>: threshold for measuring the new optimum, to only focus on
  significant changes.
* <b>`cooldown`</b>: number of epochs to wait before resuming normal operation after
  lr has been reduced.
* <b>`min_lr`</b>: lower bound on the learning rate.
