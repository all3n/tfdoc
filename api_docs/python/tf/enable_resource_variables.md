<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Resource variables are improved versions of TensorFlow variables with a
well-defined memory model. Accessing a resource variable reads its value, and
all ops which access a specific read value of the variable are guaranteed to
see the same value for that tensor. Writes which happen after a read (by
having a control or data dependency on the read) are guaranteed not to affect
the value of the read tensor, and similarly writes which happen before a read
are guaranteed to affect the value. No guarantees are made about unordered
read/write pairs.

Calling tf.enable_resource_variables() lets you opt-in to this TensorFlow 2.0
feature.
